The schedule must\n          contain the times, professors, and rooms for every class section in the department and the\n          schedule must satisfy the following constraints:\n          <ul>\n            <li>Only one section can be in a room at a time</li>\n            <li>A professor can only teach one section at a time</li>\n            <li>\n              Two sections taken together cannot be offered at the same time (e.g. CS 212 is often\n              taken together with MATH 251 and ENGR 220)\n            </li>\n            <li>Professors can only teach courses when they are available</li>\n            <li>Professors can only teach courses they are qualified to teach</li>\n            <li>Professors must/cannot teach consecutive classes depending on their preferences</li>\n            <li>A room’s capacity cannot be exceeded by the expected enrollment in the class</li>\n            <li>Faculty teaching loads cannot be “too high” or “too low”</li>\n          </ul>\n          These constraints make it extremely difficult for the department chair to create a\n          schedule without a tool to help them. We are building and adding on to a web application, named the\n          Course Schedulizer, that will allow department chairs to visualize and manipulate their\n          department course schedules. It will provide:\n          <ul>\n            <li>The ability to upload and export department schedules via CSV</li>\n            <li>Integration with the spreadsheets provided and required by the Registrar</li>\n            <li>Two views to visualize the schedule data (by location and by instructor)</li>\n            <li>Options to color the data by level, instructor, location, or prefix</li>\n            <li>Functionality to create, read, update, and delete class sections</li>\n            <li>A load summary for each instructor in the department</li>\n            <li>Schedule conflict detection and resolution suggestions</li>\n            <li>An optimized user interface with an efficient use of screen space</li>\n            <li>An extensible interface to integrate with future systems (e.g. Workday)</li>\n          </ul>\n          By offering these features and developing continuous improvements on the functionality previously implemented by\n          Professor Pruim and Professor VanderLinden, the Course Schedulizer will allow department\n          chairs to easily create their schedules.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          There is also a past Honors Project completed in year 2020 by Charles.
